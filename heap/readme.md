## Heap
-   A heap is a special tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree.
-   Heap order property: The key stored in each node is either greater than or equal to or less than or equal to the keys in the node's children, according to some total order.
-   Types of heap:
    -   Max heap: The key stored in each node is either greater than or equal to the keys in the node's children.
    -   Min heap: The key stored in each node is either less than or equal to the keys in the node's children.

## Complete Binary Tree
-   All the levels except the last level are completely full.
-   Nodes are added from left to right.
